**Describe the content or mechanics you are proposing.**
Shield point is just like repair point but instead healing 
a unit it gives the unit a shield


**Describe how you think this content will improve the game. If you're proposing new content, mention how it may add more gameplay options or how it will fill a new niche.**
So we don't have to build a pulsar or a bryde 
Just to get shield and it'll also prevent some units getting killed by lancers immediately 


**Before making this issue, place an `X` in the boxes below to confirm that you have acknowledged them.** *Failure to do so may result in your request being closed automatically.*

3. - [x] I am familiar with all the content already in the game or have glanced at the wiki to make sure my suggestion doesn't exist in the game yet.
4. - [x] I have read `README.md` to make sure my idea is not listed under the "A few things you shouldn't suggest" category.
